Front-End Demonstration for FT
============

This is a front-end demonstration put together in preparations for an interview with FT. 

Next.js 14 has the added advantage of supporting React 19 features. 

The main difference between Next.js 13 and Next.js 14 is the addition of Server Actions and Partial Prerendering.

	* Server Actions: Server Actions are asynchronous functions that can be used to perform server-side operations, such as fetching data from a database or sending an email. They are similar to React Actions, but they are executed on the server instead of the client.

	* Partial Prerendering: Partial Prerendering allows you to render dynamic content on the server, even if it depends on user input. This can improve the performance of your application, especially for initial page loads.
